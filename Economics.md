## Unemployment
- 3 types
	- **Structural**: mismatch between skills offered and demanded (e.g. AI taking over)
	- **Frictional**: unemployment between successive jobs
	- **Cyclical**: not enough *aggregate demand* in the economy for people looking for jobs (e.g. postwar/post-pandemic economic slumbers)
