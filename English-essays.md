## Delta Plan
- ***Picturesque landscapes, temperamental rivers, and a capricious climate***. These three small phrases rather tacitly, yet appropriately, capture the prospects and challenges of this beautiful piece of the world we call our motherland, Bangladesh. And yet there's an even more concise way to say all of this, that too in a single word. That word is "*delta*". Our country is part of a landform born out of the flow of rivers known as a riverine delta. And the BDP-2100 is the strategy that our government has chosen to grapple with the perils associated with being a delta that loom over us, to ***foster sustainable growth, development, and prosperity***.
- A delta is a piece of land that has been *formed over thousands of years* by the deposition of alluvium by *rivers flowing into more stagnant bodies of water*, such as a sea, a lake, or a slower-moving river. Nearly 80% of our land area forms two-thirds of what is the *biggest delta in the world*, the *Ganges delta* or the *Ganges-Brahmaputra delta*, spanning a total of some *100,000 square kilometres*.
- **Ministers come and go, even dictators die, but mountain ranges stand unperturbed.** - *Nicholas Spykman*, US Political Scientist.
- Geographical features happen to have formed over millions of years under mother nature's whims, and they rarely ever change within timescales proportionate to a human lifespan. As such, any reasonable development plans must keep them in the forefront, guiding the plans in every step of the way. Being a delta, however, is even more special, given the ***spate of hazards that it brings along***. The government has thus, prudently and aptly, channeled its efforts towards addressing this pressing issue.

## Climate change
### General info
- GHG:
	- Preindustrial: 278ppm
	- Current: 417ppm
	- GHGs in Kyoto: CO2, CH4, N2O (major)
					 H2O(g), O3, PFC, CFC
- COPs:
	- COP1 ('95) => Kyoto protocol
	- COP21 ('15) => Paris agreement:
		- Limit temperature rise to 2deg C
		- NDCs
	- COP26 ('21) => Net zero by 2050
- Each of the past 4 decades have been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850
- Arctic sea ice area reduction ('80s vs '10s):
	- September: 40%
	- March: 10%
- **Global warming**: increase in global surface temp relative to baseline (usually taken to be 1850-1900, the earliest period of reliable observation with sufficient geographical coverage)
- Arctic ice melting won't contribute to SLR directly (as the ice is floating on the arctic sea) but rather indirectly by decreasing the Earth's albedo => ++T => melting.
  However, melting of land ice does cause SLR.
- Extreme weather events => $157B lost in '20-'21 globally
- **Maplecroft** (Brit climate research institute) Climate Change Vulnerability Index: ***BD 1st*** 


### Causes of Climate Change
- **Natural**: net temperature change contribution around 0 if avg over decades
	- *Geological heat source*: volcanism
	- *Variation in solar irradiation*
	- *Variation in the Earth's orbit*
- **Human-induced**:
	- GHG (+++T)
	- Deforestation (+T)
	- Aerosols (-T)
	- Melting ice sheets (+T)
	
#### Emissions by Sector
IPCC 6th Assessment Report (2022)
- Energy: 33%
- Industry: 24%
- AFOLU: 22%
- Transport: 15%
- Buildings: 6%

#### Emissions by Country
- China: 30.9%
- USA: 13.5%
- India: 7.3%
- Russia: 4.7%
- Japan: 2.9%

### Temperature	
- **Global**: \Delta T (from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020) = 1.09dC. 
  Human caused: 1.07dC.
- **BD**:
	- Last 50y, on avg: 0.4dC
	- However locally this has been as high as 2dC in places

### SLR
- Causes:
	- Melting sea ice
	- Rising Temp => volume expansion of water
- BD 2/3rds <5m above SL
- Mean SLR (1901 to 2018) = 20cm (1.7mm/yr)
		   (2000 to 2018) = 4.8cm (3.7mm/yr)
- As per IPCC,
	- 30-45cm SLR => 35M coastal population displaced
	- By 2050, 25cm SLR => 4% land of BD
	- By 2100, 1m SLR => 17.5% land of BD

### Global Climate Diplomacy
- **Montreal protocol** '87
	- Ratified by all nations
	- Successfully brought down chemicals harming the O3 layer to zero
- **IPCC** '88
	- Established by WMO + UNEP
	- UN body responsible for compiling and assessing the latest literature on the state of affairs and guiding governments with their assessment and methodology reports
	- Nobel Peace prize '07
	- Latest: IPCC AR6 '21
		- "Starkest warning yet" - The Guardian
- **UNFCCC* '92: Established COPs
- **COP1** '95


## Environmental pollution
- BD loses **2.7%GDP/yr** due to EnvPol (WB)
- ***Brundtland report '87***: "Environment is where we live, and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable... Ensure that it meets the needs of the present wihout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"

### Air pollution
- According to the WHO, air pollution accounts for 1 in 8 deaths worldwide
- Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution
- Air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and COPD
- Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight
- Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system
- Air pollution increases the risk of dementia in people over 50 years old
- Childhood indoor air pollution may negatively affect cognitive function and neurodevelopment
