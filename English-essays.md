## Delta Plan
- ***Picturesque landscapes, temperamental rivers, and a capricious climate***. These three small phrases rather tacitly, yet appropriately, capture the prospects and challenges of this beautiful piece of the world we call our motherland, Bangladesh. And yet there's an even more concise way to say all of this, that too in a single word. That word is "*delta*". Our country is part of a landform born out of the flow of rivers known as a riverine delta. And the BDP-2100 is the strategy that our government has chosen to grapple with the perils associated with being a delta that loom over us, to ***foster sustainable growth, development, and prosperity***.

- A delta is a piece of land that has been *formed over thousands of years* by the deposition of alluvium by *rivers flowing into more stagnant bodies of water*, such as a sea, a lake, or a slower-moving river. Nearly 80% of our land area forms two-thirds of what is the *biggest delta in the world*, the *Ganges delta* or the *Ganges-Brahmaputra delta*, spanning a total of some *100,000 square kilometres*.

- **Ministers come and go, even dictators die, but mountain ranges stand unperturbed.** - *Nicholas Spykman*, US Political Scientist.

- Geographical features happen to have formed over millions of years under mother nature's whims, and they rarely ever change within timescales proportionate to a human lifespan. As such, any reasonable development plans must keep them in the forefront, guiding the plans in every step of the way. Being a delta, however, is even more special, given the ***spate of hazards that it brings along***. The government has thus, prudently and aptly, channeled its efforts towards addressing this pressing issue.

## Climate change
- The industrial revolution was quite similar to the mythical *Golden Touch of King Midas*. We were brimming with rapture and excitement as we saw everything we touched turn into gold. But alas, a grim fate much like Midas would await, something that nobody could hardly ever anticipate. The industrial revolution, *the fabled and coveted golden goose* that we'd invented, had turned us into Victor *Frankenstein*, a genius whose own creation had been his undoing. The way forward chosen by Victor, as his last words articulated in a sombre overtone, was by *seeking happiness in tranquility and avoiding ambitions*. 
- Yet we humans can't abandon ambition even in the face of impending doom. This spirit of strong convictions has many a times *pushed the limits of our abilities as a species*. These were times when we *acknowledged the obstacles and chose to grow*. At other times though, this has inspired *emboldened stupidity*, as charging towards mammoth obstacles with no preparations as to how to tackle them would only end in smoke.
- Many *developed countries* who bear the *bulk of the responsibility* are relatively *nonchalant to execute policies* that they think gives others a share of the pie by taking a bit away from theirs, which certainly is the most terrible injustice, at least from their vantage point.

### Effects of Climate Change
#### Temperature	
- **Global warming**: increase in global surface temp relative to baseline (usually taken to be 1850-1900, the earliest period of reliable observation with sufficient geographical coverage)
- Each of the **past 4 decades** have been **successively warmer than any decade that preceded** it since 1850
- **Global**: 
	- **1.2°C warming so far** compared to preindustrial times
	- *Current state of policies* in different countries gives a projected warming of **2.7°C by 2100**
	- Full implementation of *pledges and commitments* so far would limit that to *2.1°C* at best.
- **Human impact**: ∆T (from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020) = 1.09°C. 
  Human caused: 1.07°C.
- **BD**:
	- Last 50y, on avg: **0.4°C**
	- However locally this has been as high as 2°C in places
	- 4.8% working hours will be lost by 2030 due to heat stress, leading to a near-5% GDP loss ($30B)

#### SLR
- Causes:
	- Melting sea ice
	- Rising Temp => volume expansion of water
- Mean SLR (1901 to 2018) = 20cm (1.7mm/yr)
		   (2000 to 2018) = 4.8cm (3.7mm/yr)
- Arctic ice melting won't contribute to SLR directly (as the ice is floating on the arctic sea) but rather indirectly by decreasing the Earth's albedo => ++T => melting.
  However, melting of land ice does cause SLR.
- Arctic sea ice area reduction ('80s vs 2010s):
	- September: 40%
	- March: 10%
- **BD**:
	- 2/3rds area <5m above SL
	- As per IPCC,
		- 30-45cm SLR => 35M coastal population displaced
		- By *2050*, *25cm* SLR => *4%* land permanently inundated
		- By *2100*, *100cm* SLR => *17.5%*
	- *↓30% food production*
	- *1/3rd* population @risk of *displacement by 2100*
	- 30% area inundated in regular floods, 67% in major floods
	- *1.5% GDP loss/yr* by 2031

#### Lightning strikes
- ↑12% if ΔT=1°C

#### Climate-induced disasters
- More frequent extreme weather events
	- Heatwaves
	- Droughts
	- Wildfires
	- Heavy rainfall => flooding
	- Storms / cyclones
- **BD**:
	- *$1.8B lost/yr* from '00-'20
	- *$4B loss/yr* by 2030

#### Human lives and economy
- **Health impacts**: Direct damage costs to health *~$3B/yr* (WHO)
	- *Direct impacts*:
		- Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and floods can cause injury, illness, and death
		- WHO: *37% heat-related deaths* by human-induced climate change
	- *Indirect impacts*: Changes in temperature and rainfall can alter the survival, distribution, and behavior of insects and microbes, leading to *changes in infectious diseases*. Increases in precipitation, storm surge, and sea temperature can lead to more *water-related illnesses*
	- *Air quality*:
		- air pollution => ↓respiratory and cardiovascular health
		- air pollution causes 1 in 8 deaths worldwide
	- *Food safety*: ↓food production, ↑foodborne illnesses due to ↑temperature being suitable for microbial multiplication
	- *Mental health*
		
- **Economic impacts**:
	- GDP loss for ΔT = 2℃ :
		- World: ~11%
		- Asia, MENA: ~14-15%
		
- **BD**: 
	- *~150k excess deaths/yr*
	- *6.8% GDP loss/yr*

## Environmental pollution
### Intro
> "When the last tree is cut down, the last fish eaten, the last stream poisoned, you will realise that you cannot eat money" - John May

Man's quest for "development" defines the modern era of our civilisation. Although it has always been part of the human agenda, for the longest part of history, mankind has been subject to the whims of mother nature. Prosperity was mostly within the confines she had set for us.
But the mankind is a species of unfathomable potential. We not only persevered, but we invented. The invention of the steam engine by the illustrious inventor James Watt was the watershed moment that made man the subduer instead of the subdued, and then we never looked back. The days of worry were over. Even the poor of the industrial societies could consume a lot more, and hence were economically better off, compared to the "middle-class" of the pre-industrial times. Mankind had hit its puberty, its growth spurt had begun. Yet within all this shimmer, something was missing. We couldn't pinpoint exactly what, but many elderlies readily recognised that what was missing was the connection to mother nature. Much like an unruly child who enters into a rebellious adolescence, we pushed our economies further and further chasing the dreams of prosperity with no compunction, extracting more and more out of nature, until she started to show the signs of illness.
We find ourselves at a historical crossroads where we have to pick between developing wisely ensuring the best of nature, or choosing to run amok until the entirety of our much-vaunted economy faces imminent implosion. As such, it is of paramount importance to address pollution much, much louder than ever before, now more than ever.


- BD loses **2.7%GDP/yr** due to EnvPol (WB)
- Introduction of **contaminants**, usually of **anthropogenic source** that **adversely change** the environment
	- Anthropogenic source: manufacturing, extraction, waste disposal, transport, agriculture
- Pollutant:
	- Substances: Solid, liquid, gas
	- Energy: radioactivity, heat, sound, light
- Over the *past two decades*, **deaths caused by the modern forms of pollution** have **increased by 66%**, driven by
	- industrialisation
	- uncontrolled urbanisation
	- population growth
	- fossil fuel combustion
	- an absence of adequate national or international chemical policy.
- **>9 million deaths/yr globally**. This number has not changed since 2015.
	- **More than AIDS, TB, Malaria killings combined**
- **>90% of pollution-related deaths** occur in *low and middle-income countries*
- ***Brundtland report '87***: "Environment is where we live, and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable... Ensure that it meets the needs of the present wihout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"
- "The **triad of pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss* are the **key global environmental issues** of our time." - *The Lancet Planetary Health*, Pollution and Health: A Progress Update.
- Men are more likely to die from air pollution, lead pollution, and occupational pollutants than women. Women and children are more likely to die from water pollution.


### Air pollution
- According to the *WHO*, air pollution *accounts for 1 in 8 deaths* (6.67M/yr due to air pollution out of ~50M/yr total deaths) worldwide
- Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution
- Air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and COPD
- Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight
- Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system
- Air pollution increases the risk of dementia in people over 50 years old
- Childhood indoor air pollution may negatively affect cognitive function and neurodevelopment
- Air pollution is *entwined with climate change* because the emissions driving both come largely from the same sources (eg, fossil fuel or biofuel burning)
	- Burning fuels => fine and ultrafine particulates (eg, PM2·5 and others), long-lived greenhouse gases, and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)
	- SLCPs:
		- Simultaneously warmer and polluter
		- CH4, black carbon (ie, soot), and hydrofluorocarbons
		- CH4 => 1/3rd of all GHG-related warming, 1/2 of all human-induced warming
		- ~15y lifepan in the atmosphere => cacn be leveraged to quickly impact climate change and  pollution

### Water pollution


### Land pollution


### Sound pollution


### Chemical pollution
- Chemical poisoning (e.g. Pb) kills 1.8M/yr worldwide
- More than 800 million children are estimated to have blood lead concentrations that exceed 5·0 μg/dL
- Children with blood lead concentrations higher than, or equal to, 5·0 μg/dL could score 3–5 points lower on intelligence tests 
- Lead-related IQ losses are associated with increased rates of school failure, behavioural disorders, diminished economic productivity, and global economic losses of almost $1 trillion annually. In Africa, the economic losses from lead-related IQ loss are equivalent to about 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) and in Asia, these losses are equivalent to 2% of GDP.
- sources of lead exposure: unsound recycling of lead–acid batteries and e-waste without pollution controls; spices that are contaminated with lead; pottery glazed with lead salts, which leach out into acidic foods; and lead in paint and other consumer products.
- Toxicity:
	- Neuro
	- Fertility
	- Immuno: perfluoroalkyl acids => reduced antibody responses to vaccines

### Radioactive pollution


### Plastic pollution


### Conclusion
 The problems associated with pollution will likely plague us for decades to come, but we are at a tipping-point where we still can prevent a runaway collapse of the entire ecosystem. As we move forward, we must choose and invent ways to develop our economy without exploiting the nature.
