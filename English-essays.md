## Delta Plan
- ***Picturesque landscapes, temperamental rivers, and a capricious climate***. These three small phrases rather tacitly, yet appropriately, capture the prospects and challenges of this beautiful piece of the world we call our motherland, Bangladesh. And yet there's an even more concise way to say all of this, that too in a single word. That word is "*delta*". Our country is part of a landform born out of the flow of rivers known as a riverine delta. And the BDP-2100 is the strategy that our government has chosen to grapple with the perils associated with being a delta that loom over us, to ***foster sustainable growth, development, and prosperity***.

- A delta is a piece of land that has been *formed over thousands of years* by the deposition of alluvium by *rivers flowing into more stagnant bodies of water*, such as a sea, a lake, or a slower-moving river. Nearly 80% of our land area forms two-thirds of what is the *biggest delta in the world*, the *Ganges delta* or the *Ganges-Brahmaputra delta*, spanning a total of some *100,000 square kilometres*.

- **Ministers come and go, even dictators die, but mountain ranges stand unperturbed.** - *Nicholas Spykman*, US Political Scientist.

- Geographical features happen to have formed over millions of years under mother nature's whims, and they rarely ever change within timescales proportionate to a human lifespan. As such, any reasonable development plans must keep them in the forefront, guiding the plans in every step of the way. Being a delta, however, is even more special, given the ***spate of hazards that it brings along***. The government has thus, prudently and aptly, channeled its efforts towards addressing this pressing issue.

## Climate change
- The industrial revolution was quite similar to the mythical *Golden Touch of King Midas*. We were brimming with rapture and excitement as we saw everything we touched turn into gold. But alas, a grim fate much like Midas would await, something that nobody could hardly ever anticipate. The industrial revolution, *the fabled and coveted golden goose* that we'd invented, had turned us into Victor *Frankenstein*, a genius whose own creation had been his undoing. The way forward chosen by Victor, as his last words articulated in a sombre overtone, was by *seeking happiness in tranquility and avoiding ambitions*. 
- Yet we humans can't abandon ambition even in the face of impending doom. This spirit of strong convictions has many a times *pushed the limits of our abilities as a species*. These were times when we *acknowledged the obstacles and chose to grow*. At other times though, this has inspired *emboldened stupidity*, as charging towards mammoth obstacles with no preparations as to how to tackle them would only end in smoke.
- Many *developed countries* who bear the *bulk of the responsibility* are relatively *nonchalant to execute policies* that they think gives others a share of the pie by taking a bit away from theirs, which certainly is the most terrible injustice, at least from their vantage point.

### Effects of Climate Change
#### Temperature	
- **Global warming**: increase in global surface temp relative to baseline (usually taken to be 1850-1900, the earliest period of reliable observation with sufficient geographical coverage)
- Each of the **past 4 decades** have been **successively warmer than any decade that preceded** it since 1850
- **Global**: 
	- **1.2°C warming so far** compared to preindustrial times
	- *Current state of policies* in different countries gives a projected warming of **2.7°C by 2100**
	- Full implementation of *pledges and commitments* so far would limit that to *2.1°C* at best.
- **Human impact**: ∆T (from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020) = 1.09°C. 
  Human caused: 1.07°C.
- **BD**:
	- Last 50y, on avg: **0.4°C**
	- However locally this has been as high as 2°C in places
	- 4.8% working hours will be lost by 2030 due to heat stress, leading to a near-5% GDP loss ($30B)

#### SLR
- Causes:
	- Melting sea ice
	- Rising Temp => volume expansion of water
- Mean SLR (1901 to 2018) = 20cm (1.7mm/yr)
		   (2000 to 2018) = 4.8cm (3.7mm/yr)
- Arctic ice melting won't contribute to SLR directly (as the ice is floating on the arctic sea) but rather indirectly by decreasing the Earth's albedo => ++T => melting.
  However, melting of land ice does cause SLR.
- Arctic sea ice area reduction ('80s vs 2010s):
	- September: 40%
	- March: 10%
- **BD**:
	- 2/3rds area <5m above SL
	- As per IPCC,
		- 30-45cm SLR => 35M coastal population displaced
		- By *2050*, *25cm* SLR => *4%* land permanently inundated
		- By *2100*, *100cm* SLR => *17.5%*
	- *↓30% food production*
	- *1/3rd* population @risk of *displacement by 2100*
	- 30% area inundated in regular floods, 67% in major floods
	- *1.5% GDP loss/yr* by 2031

#### Lightning strikes
- ↑12% if ΔT=1°C

#### Climate-induced disasters
- More frequent extreme weather events
	- Heatwaves
	- Droughts
	- Wildfires
	- Heavy rainfall => flooding
	- Storms / cyclones
- **BD**:
	- *$1.8B lost/yr* from '00-'20
	- *$4B loss/yr* by 2030

#### Human lives and economy
- **Health impacts**: Direct damage costs to health *~$3B/yr* (WHO)
	- *Direct impacts*:
		- Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and floods can cause injury, illness, and death
		- WHO: *37% heat-related deaths* by human-induced climate change
	- *Indirect impacts*: Changes in temperature and rainfall can alter the survival, distribution, and behavior of insects and microbes, leading to *changes in infectious diseases*. Increases in precipitation, storm surge, and sea temperature can lead to more *water-related illnesses*
	- *Air quality*:
		- air pollution => ↓respiratory and cardiovascular health
		- air pollution causes 1 in 8 deaths worldwide
	- *Food safety*: ↓food production, ↑foodborne illnesses due to ↑temperature being suitable for microbial multiplication
	- *Mental health*
- **BD**:
	- *~150k excess deaths/yr*
	- *6.8% GDP loss/yr*

	- Ratified by all nations
	- Successfully brought down chemicals harming the O3 layer to zero
- **IPCC** '88
	- Established by WMO + UNEP
	- UN body responsible for compiling and assessing the latest literature on the state of affairs and guiding governments with their assessment and methodology reports

		- "Starkest warning yet" - The Guardian
- **Earth summit** '92: adoption of 3 major Rio conventions, the most prominent one being UNFCCC. The others are UN convention on biological diversity, and the Convention to combat desertification.
	- **UNFCCC* '92: 
		- Recognised the problem
		- Established COPs for regular review
		- Onus on the developed (annex I) countries
- **COP3** '97, Kyoto
	- **Kyoto protocol**:
		- Operationalizes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets

		- 1st commitment period ('08-'12): 5% reduction from '90 levels
		- 2nd commitment period ('13-'20, Doha amendment): 18% reduction from '90 levels
		- Flexible "market-mechanisms" in case countries fail to meet targets:
			- **Emissions trading**: countries with allowed emissions to spare can sell them to countries that need to emit more than their allowance
			- **Clean development mechanism**: financing emission reduction in developed countries
- **COP16** '10, Cancun, Mexico: decision to make $100B/y **GCF**
- **COP21** '15, Paris:

- ***Brundtland report '87***: "Environment is where we live, and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable... Ensure that it meets the needs of the present wihout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"

### Air pollution
- According to the WHO, air pollution accounts for 1 in 8 deaths worldwide
- Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution
- Air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and COPD
- Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight
- Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system
- Air pollution increases the risk of dementia in people over 50 years old
- Childhood indoor air pollution may negatively affect cognitive function and neurodevelopment
