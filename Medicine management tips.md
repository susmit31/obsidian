## Iron supplement calculation
Suppose the patient's Hb level is 7g/dL, and the target level is 10g/dL.

Then the deficit is 3g/dL.

On average, humans have a blood volume of 70 mL/kg body wt. For a 60 kg female, this amounts to 42 dL. The absolute Hb deficit then is 42\*3 g = 126 g.

For making each gram of Hb, we need 3.5 mg Fe (this is since the molar weight of Hb is 64kg and each mole contains 4 moles of Fe, so each gram of Hb contains 3.5 mg of Fe). Therefore the patient needs 126\*3.5 mg ≈ 450 mg Fe to restore her Hb levels.

---

There's one caveat though. If the Hb is low due to IDA, the Fe storage in the body itself must also be low. So to replenish the storage, we need about 500 more mgs of Fe.

So in total, we infuse the patient with Maltofer 1g IV. This is the maximum recommended dose of IV Fe per week.

If we're going for oral therapy, the available forms are as follows.

|Trade name | Composition | Form|
|:----------|:------------|-----|
|Hemofix|Fe-Ascorbate 275mg|Tab|
|Hemofix FZ|Fe-Ascorbate 48mg, Folate ½mg, Zn 22½mg |Tab|

---
The absorption rate of oral iron is 10%. To replete the iron stores and replenish Hb levels, we then need to supplement this patient with Hemofix (010) for at least 36 days or about a month. With Hemofix FZ, we need about 6 months to replenish the same amount. Since that's typically infeasible and unduly long, we use IV supplementation for Hb 9 and below. If, however, the Hb is above 9g/dL, the deficit amounts to around 42g\*3.4 mg/g + 500 mg Fe = 142 mg + 500 mg Fe ≈ 650mg Fe. This amount can be given by 650\*10/48 ≈ 130 days ≈ 4 months of Hemofix FZ oral supplementation.

## Diagnosing basal versus bolus insulin deficit
- Normally, 2HABF ≈ 1½ FBS.
- If ↑FBS, 2HABF and 2HABF ≈ 1½ FBS, then the problem is in basal insulin secretion 
- If ↑FBS, 2HABF and 2HABF > 1½ FBS, then the problem is in postprandial bolus insulin secretion

- Avoid contact lenses 
**Drugs**
- Bacterial =>
    - Optimox 0.5% E/D - 1 drop TDS for 7-14d
    - Optimox oint. => Use @bedtime - 7d
    - Drylief E/D => 1 drop TDS - 7d
- Allergic =>
    - Olopan 0.1% E/D - 1 drop BD for 14d
    - Alcet 5 mg - 0+0+1 - 10d
- Viral =>
    - Drylief E/D => 1 drop TDS - 7d

## DKA
### Diagnosis 
- RBS > 11 mmol/L (usually > 14)
- Blood ketone bodies > 3 mmol/L
- Urinary ketone bodies > 2+
- Kussmaul breathing
	- Deep breaths with normal respiratory rate
- Acetone breath
- Nausea, vomiting, hypotension

### Management
- Problems that need to be solved:
	- Hyperglycaemia
	- Hypovolaemia (100mL/kg fluid loss -> ≈ 6-7L in average adult)
	- Hypokalaemia: arises from the insulin pumped into the body for correcting the hyperglycaemia
