Since your focus is on formalizing meaning mathematically, especially using category theory and computational models, here are some relevant books and resources:


---

1. Formal Semantics & Mathematical Approaches to Meaning

These books treat meaning as a structured, mathematically formal entity:

1. Montague Semantics (Formal Linguistics & Logic)

Formal Philosophy – Richard Montague (classic but technical).

Mathematical Methods in Linguistics – Barbara Partee et al. (bridges linguistics with logic and set theory).

Relevance: Treats meaning as a function from linguistic expressions to interpretations, which aligns with your S → C mapping.



2. Category Theory & Linguistics

Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists – Benjamin Pierce (concise and structured).

Conceptual Mathematics – Lawvere & Schanuel (applies category theory to meaning structures).

Relevance: Functors and adjunctions can model relationships between symbols and concepts, similar to your framework.





---

2. Computational Models of Meaning & Cognition

Since you’re exploring computational neuroscience, these could help bridge cognition and formal semantics:

3. Probabilistic & Vector-Space Models of Meaning

Probabilistic Linguistics – Rens Bod, Jennifer Hay, Stefanie Jannedy (Bayesian approaches to meaning).

Speech and Language Processing – Jurafsky & Martin (computational models of semantics and pragmatics).

Relevance: If your concept space has a vector-like structure, these approaches can help refine meaning embeddings.



4. Cognitive & Neural Basis of Meaning

The Geometry of Meaning – Peter Gärdenfors (conceptual spaces and semantic geometry).

How to Build a Brain – Chris Eliasmith (computational cognitive models of meaning).

Relevance: Gärdenfors’ work on conceptual spaces is close to your idea of C as a structured manifold.





---

3. Philosophical Foundations of Formal Meaning

If you want something rigorous but philosophically deep, these might interest you:

5. Philosophy of Language & Information Theory

Word and Object – Willard Van Orman Quine (meaning, reference, and translation problems).

Information and the Nature of Reality – Paul Davies & Niels Henrik Gregersen (info-theoretic perspectives on meaning).

Relevance: If you’re thinking of symbolic meaning as information processing, this could be useful.



6. Structuralist & Categorical Approaches to Meaning

Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic – Robert Goldblatt (category theory + logic).

An Invitation to Applied Category Theory – Brendan Fong & David Spivak (applications in semantics and AI).

Relevance: Higher-order structures (topoi, adjoint functors) might help refine your meaning mappings.

Where to Start?

If you want a linguistic formalism → Montague or Partee.

If you want category theory applied to meaning → Lawvere, Fong & Spivak.

If you want a cognitive model of meaning → Gärdenfors, Eliasmith.

If you want computational meaning models → Jurafsky & Martin.


## 2. Category Theory 
For your concept space framework, the most relevant areas of category theory would be those that help you formalize mappings, structure, and transformations between different spaces (concept space, symbol space, meaning mappings). Here’s a focused study plan tailored to your project:


---

Phase 1: Core Category Theory (2–3 weeks)

These basics will help you set up your framework with a solid foundation:

1. Categories, Objects, and Morphisms

Why categories? Formalizing relationships between structures.

Examples:

Set (category of sets and functions) → Useful for basic symbol manipulation.

Vect (category of vector spaces and linear maps) → Relevant since you use linear algebra.


Application: Concepts as objects, meaning mappings as morphisms.



2. Functors and Natural Transformations

Functors: Mapping between categories (e.g., mapping symbols to concepts).

Natural transformations: Comparing two different functors systematically.

Application: Different ways to encode meaning (e.g., literal vs. metaphorical) could be modeled as different functors, with natural transformations describing their relationships.




Resources:

Category Theory for the Sciences – David Spivak (gentle, applied).

Bartosz Milewski’s Category Theory for Programmers (good intuition).



---

Phase 2: Structure and Mappings (3–4 weeks)

This will help formalize how meaning is assigned dynamically.

3. Universal Properties and Limits

Products and coproducts: Structuring compound concepts.

Equalizers and pullbacks: Handling ambiguity in meaning.

Application: Modeling how meanings emerge from multiple interacting inputs (e.g., context-dependent interpretation).



4. Adjunctions and Monads

Adjunctions: Capture dualities in meaning (e.g., abstract vs. concrete concepts).

Monads: Structure sequential transformations (e.g., meaning-building in discourse).

Application: Could help model how meaning accumulates through sequential thought or conversation.




Resources:

Basic Category Theory – Tom Leinster (succinct, focused).

Steve Awodey’s lectures on YouTube.



---

Phase 3: Advanced Topics & Applications (Ongoing)

5. Yoneda Lemma

Captures the idea that an object is fully determined by its relationships (very relevant for modeling meaning through relational structures).

Application: The meaning of a concept could be determined by its interactions with other concepts rather than its intrinsic properties.



6. Topos Theory (Optional but Interesting)

Categories as generalized spaces (bridging category theory with topology and logic).

Application: If concept space is a manifold, topos theory could provide an abstract way to structure it.




Resources:

Category Theory in Context – Emily Riehl (for rigorous treatment).

nLab wiki for specific topics.



---

Practical Steps

Solve exercises to internalize the abstract ideas.

Visualize concepts using commutative diagrams.

Try applying each new concept to your framework and see if it helps clarify any part of your model.


## 3. Category Theory 0
Here’s a structured study plan to cover the essentials of category theory, tailored to your background and goals:

Phase 1: Foundations (1–2 weeks)

Before diving into advanced topics, start with the basics:

1. Categories, Objects, and Morphisms

Definitions: category, object, morphism (arrow), composition, identity.

Examples: Set, Monoid, Group, Vector Spaces, Posets as categories.



2. Functors and Natural Transformations

Covariant and contravariant functors.

Examples: Forgetful functors, Hom functors.

Natural transformations as “morphisms between functors.”




Resources:

Category Theory for the Sciences by David Spivak (gentle introduction).

Conceptual Mathematics by Lawvere & Schanuel (intuitive approach).

Bartosz Milewski’s Category Theory for Programmers (free online book).



---

Phase 2: Structure and Abstraction (2–3 weeks)

Once comfortable with basic definitions, explore deeper structures:
3. Universal Properties and Limits

Terminal & initial objects.

Products and coproducts.

Equalizers, coequalizers, pullbacks, pushouts.


4. Adjunctions and Monads

Definition of adjoint functors (unit & counit).

Understanding monads as monoids in the category of endofunctors.

How monads relate to computational effects (optional but useful).

Kan extensions (generalizing limits and adjoints).

Topos theory (if you want to link category theory to logic).



6. Applications to Your Work

Look at categories of spaces and smooth maps (relevant for differential geometry).

Functorial semantics (interpreting structures categorically).

Categorical models of meaning (useful for concept space modeling).




Resources:

Category Theory in Context by Emily Riehl (rigorous but well-explained).

nLab (wiki for category theory and related mathematics).



---

How to Approach This?

Focus on examples rather than just abstract definitions.

Try to visualize concepts (commutative diagrams help a lot).

Work through exercises—category theory is abstract, but examples ground intuition.

Apply concepts to your own framework whenever possible.


## 4. Computational Neuroscience 
Yes, absolutely. Computational neuroscience could provide a lot of insight into how concepts, meaning, and cognition emerge from underlying neural processes. Given that your framework already leans on mathematical formalism, studying computational models of the brain could help in several ways:

1. Understanding Concept Representation in the Brain

Your concept space framework assumes that concepts can be represented mathematically. Computational neuroscience explores how neurons encode information, which could inform your understanding of how concepts might be structured biologically.

Neural manifolds: There’s evidence that the brain represents information in high-dimensional manifolds (e.g., in motor control, sensory processing, and even abstract cognition).

Dimensionality reduction: Techniques like PCA and nonlinear embedding methods (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) are often used to study neural data. These could help you refine how to model your concept space mathematically.


2. Learning and Adaptation

Your framework needs to account for how mappings from symbols to concepts change over time. Computational neuroscience covers:

Hebbian learning and synaptic plasticity (how connections change with experience).

Predictive coding (how the brain constantly updates its internal models based on new information).

Bayesian inference models (how the brain represents uncertainty and adapts probabilistically).


These could help you refine your notion of how meaning "updates" dynamically in your framework.

3. Modeling Meaning as an Emergent Property

You’ve argued that meaning is an emergent property of syntactic manipulation. Computational models of cognition (e.g., deep learning, recurrent networks, and transformer models) show how structured representations can emerge from simple rules. Studying:

Self-organizing maps (SOMs)

Hopfield networks

Deep neural embeddings
could help you design an emergent meaning model that aligns with what we observe in the brain.


4. Handling Non-assertive Speech Acts

Your concern about formal logic struggling with non-assertive speech acts (commands, questions, etc.) might be addressed through reinforcement learning and goal-directed models of cognition. The brain doesn’t just process meaning statically; it does so in a way that aligns with goals and interactions.
