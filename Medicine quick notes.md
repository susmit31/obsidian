- **SLR (straight leg raise) test:** compresses lumbosacral nerve roots; tests for radiculopathy (neurogenic claudication)
- **Dengue NS1**:
	- Protein secreted by cells infected by flaviviruses (ergo, *non-structural*)
	- So will be detected as long as there are cells that are infected (about 4-5 days or so)
	- From day 4/5 onwards, do IgM
- **Arterial vs neurogenic claudication**

||Arterial|Neurogenic|
|----|----|------------|
|Site|Muscle|Diffuse|
|Onset|Claudication distance|Immediately on walking/standing|
|Laterality|Usually unilateral|Often bilateral|
|Colour|Normal/Pale|Normal|
|Temperature|Normal/Cool|Normal|
|Pulse|â†“|Normal|
|SLR|Normal|May be reduced|
