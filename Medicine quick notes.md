- **SLR (straight leg raise) test:** compresses lumbosacral nerve roots; tests for radiculopathy (neurogenic claudication)
- **Dengue NS1**:
	- Protein secreted by cells infected by flaviviruses (ergo, *non-structural*)
	- So will be detected as long as there are cells that are infected (about 4-5 days or so)
	- From day 4/5 onwards, do IgM
- **Arterial vs neurogenic claudication**

||Arterial|Neurogenic|
|----|----|------------|
|Site|Muscle|Diffuse|
|Onset|**Claudication distance**|Immediately on walking/standing|
|Laterality|Usually unilateral|Often bilateral|
|Colour|Normal/Pale|Normal|
|Temperature|**Normal/Cool**|Normal|
|Pulse|**↓**|Normal|
|SLR|Normal|**May be reduced**|

- **CREST syndrome**: cutaneous calcinosis, Raynaud's, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia (associated with systemic sclerosis)
- **Causes of puffy face**
	- CKD
	- Hypoalbuminaemia due to any cause
	- SVC syndrome (obstruction of SVC by mediastinal tumour)
	- Hypothyroidism
- **Anti-TB drug dosing**

|Weight|No. of tablets per day|
|-------|-----|
|30-37 kg| 2|
|38-54 kg| 3|
|55-70 kg| 4|
|> 70kg| 5|

- Sample prescription for category 1 TB patient weighing 60kg:
	- Tab. Rimstar 4FDC
		- 4+0+0 -> 2 months, then
	- Tab. Rimstar 2FDC
		- 4+0+0 -> 4 months
- Nitrofurantoin => severely nauseating; always prescribe with an antiemetic
- **COX-1 vs COX-2**:
	- COX-1: 
			- *Constitutively expressed* by GI mucosa
			- *Mucosal integrity, platelet aggregation, renal blood flow* => nonselective NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac) are GI and nephro toxic.
	- COX-2:
		- *Induced by cytokines*
		- *Pain, inflammation*
		- GI and renal risk ↓↓ => etoricoxin, celecoxib safest 
- Antidote of ***rivaroxaban*** => ***andexanet alpha***
- Antidote of ***dabigatran*** => ***idarucizumab***
- **Rhythm control in AF**
	- Immediate cardioversion if AF < 48h
		- IV flecainide (2 mg/kg, max 150 mg, over 30 mins)
	- Else, defer cardioversion until patient has been on 4 weeks of anticoagulant and underlying problem e.g. htn has been corrected (as intracardiac clots may have formed by 48h)
	- Anticoagulation should be started ≥ 4 weeks before and ≥ 3 months after cardioversion

	- <u>*Advice*</u>
		- $\downarrow$ weight, $\downarrow$ alcohol
		- Avoid uraemic drugs: thiazide, ACEi, $\beta$-b
		- Add uricosuric drugs: losartan
