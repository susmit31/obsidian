## General
- A renowned leftist author once visited the Soviet union during a time of big purges and show trials. Trying to convince him of the necessity of these operations, he was told the proverb *"to make an omelette, you must first break an egg"*, to which he tersely replied, ***"Okay, I can see the broken eggs. But where's this omelette of yours?"***. The omelette and eggs make an apt metaphor for the ***ever-widening gulf between the promise of development and reality***.
- "আমি রাজনীতির কথা বলছিনা। আমি বলছি বাঙালী জাতির ভবিষ্যতের কথা। ***সমস্ত রাজনৈতিক সত্যের ওপর একটা বড় সত্য আছে। সেটা বাঙালী জাতির অস্তিত্ব***। বাঙালী জাতির ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ভর করে হিন্দু-মুসলিম ঐক্যের ওপর" - আচার্য প্রফুল্লচন্দ্র রায়

## § Economics
- In his book *And Forgive Them Their Debts*, Prof Michael Hudson illustrates how Babylonians first noticed that while the *economy* (people's ability to produce value i.e. the *supply of value*) grew along an *S-shaped curve* (i.e. tapered off after a period of growth), in tandem with the population, *finance* (people's need for value i.e. the *demand for value*) grew *exponentially*. In other words, ***debts grow faster than the economy's ability to pay.***
