The first line goes to the *challenge*, which as you say, the wannabe protagonist can't overcome. State it in a form similar to a *universal truth*.
- Identify 2 more keywords. Explain what each of the five keywords entail. That's your *somprosharito vaab*. Add how these interact with each other. Gradually build your argument towards a logical demonstration in favour of the given quote.
- Finally, *uposonghar* is where you tie everything together, advising the humankind like a sage. And finish things off with an aptly chosen quote.
