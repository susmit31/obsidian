## Clinical Exam
- B12 deficiency => Atrophic glossitis, angular stomatitis
	- Atrophic glossitis: B12, folate, Fe deficiency
- Malabsorption => Clubbing
- Ulcerative colitis (UC) => pyoderma gangrenosum

## Anatomy & Physiology
- Most cancers by site: GIT

### Swallowing
- Swallowing reflex coordinated in **medulla**
- Upper oeso sphincter => *cricopharyngeus muscle*

### Neurohumoral mechanisms
#### Gastric secretion
- **Stimulants** of acid secretion: GHA (acid secretion hoile GHA hobe)
	- *Gastrin* (acts on  **CCK-2R** receptors on parietal cell / ECL)
	- *Histamine* (acts on H2 receptors on PC)
		- Released by **ECL cells** in response to Gastrin on ECL
	- *ACh* (acts on ACh-R (M3) receptors on PC)
- **Proton pump**:
	- H+-K+-ATPase pump
	- @ *apical membrane* of *parietal cells*
	- Intrinsic factor (for B12 absorption) released in parallel with acid
- **Pepsinogen**
	- Secreted by *chief cells*
	- Activated by HCl
- **Protective factors** from HCl and pepsin
	- HCO3-
	- Mucin
	- TFF (trefoil factor family) proteins

#### Gastrin, somatostatin, ghrelin
- **Gastrin**
	- Source: *G cells* in antrum
	- ↑ Acid secretion, mucosal growth
- **Somatostatin**
	- Source: *D cells* throughout GIT
	- ↓ Acid secretion, mucosal growth
- **Ghrelin**: makes you eat and digest more
	- Source: *Oxyntic glands*
	- ↑ Acid, appetite, emptying

### Digestion and Absorption
#### Fat
1. **Luminal phase**: partly emulsified fat due to gastric motility => *CCK by duodenum* =>
	- *GB contraction* => bile secretion
	- *Pancreatic enzyme* secretion =>
		- *Amylase*
		- *Lipase*
		- *Colipase*
		- *Protease*
	- *Relaxed Sphincter of Oddi*
2. **Digestion / Micelle formation**: Pancreatic lipase and colipase break down lipid droplets to FFA, MGs, cholesterol => packaged by bile salt to form micelles
3. **Micelle absorption**: soluble micelles travel towards the enterocyte surface and unload their lipid contents
4. **Re-esterification / Chylomicron formation**: FFAs within the enterocytes re-esterify to form TGs. TG + fat-soluble vitamins + cholesterol ester packaged by apoproteins => chylomicrons.

#### Carbs
- End products: alpha-limit dextran, maltose, maltotriose
- Fructose => simple diffusion; glucose, galactose => facilitated diffusion

#### Proteins
