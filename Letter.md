My lovely better half, Mrs Sarif,
I'm sure you still quite vividly remember, like myself, the start of our wonderful journey on the 3rd of November, 2022. On that fateful day, I confessed my love for you for the first, but not the last, time. 

And then, 2 months ago, I became the luckiest man on earth when I got the most perfect girl ever as my wife. 

It's been just 5 months, but I already feel like I've loved you for ages. You used to worry if my love would dwindle over time - Sharmila once said that part of why we were so deeply in love was because we were still in the "butterflies in stomach phase". 

But no, our love hasn't dwindled over these few months. Sure, we've had some ups and downs and some bitter arguments. But at the end of the day, our love for each other was what prevailed. And it will keep prevailing till our last breaths, in shaa Allah.

Every moment I am with you, I fall even deeper in love with you. Every moment I am not with you, my heart writhes in agony. I'm eternally grateful for every single second I've had with you. You are my heaven on earth, my sweetheart. 

There are times when I'm inconsiderate, stupid, and unreasonable. My apologies for every single time I've hurt you, my love. I never meant to. Do know that despite my acts of stupidity, I love you from the deepest corner of my heart. I am trying my hardest to correct myself. I really am sorry, baby.

I know you panic from time to time thinking about the tortuous path of struggle that lies ahead of us. The journey is tough, but as long as we're in it together, we can achieve ANYTHING, in shaa Allah. Have faith, my love. Surely better times are yet to come.

2 months gone, in shaa Allah an eternity more to come.
Your stupid husband,
Mr Chamchik.
