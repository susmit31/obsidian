# Bringing Back Laundered Money

## Policy Brief: Invoking UNCAC for Recovery of Illicit Assets Laundered from Bangladesh

### Executive Summary

This brief recommends that the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) immediately invoke relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) to pursue the identification, freezing, and repatriation of assets illicitly laundered abroad over the past 15 years. Bangladesh, as a ratifying State Party to UNCAC since 2007, is entitled to full cooperation under Chapter V of the Convention.

### Background

Significant evidence has emerged indicating massive capital flight and systemic corruption during the rule of the previous regime. Preliminary estimates suggest billions of U.S. dollars were transferred out of the country, often through trade-based money laundering, offshore shell companies, and illicit real estate purchases.

### Legal Basis

UNCAC provides a comprehensive framework for:

- International legal cooperation (Articles 46, 54–55)

- Civil recovery of assets (Article 53)

- Non-conviction-based confiscation (Article 54.1c)

- Mandatory asset return for embezzlement (Article 57.3a)


### Recommendations

1. Immediately issue MLA requests to target jurisdictions, citing UNCAC Chapter V articles.


2. Request asset freezing orders under Article 55.


3. Launch civil litigation for asset recovery in jurisdictions like UAE, UK, Canada, and Singapore, invoking Article 53.


4. Establish a high-level UNCAC Asset Recovery Task Force to coordinate legal, diplomatic, and investigative actions.

The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), specifically Articles 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, and 57, to which both our countries are State Parties;

Relevant provisions of your national law allowing for international cooperation in asset recovery.

Specific individuals and entities have been identified, with supporting documentation enclosed.

#### Legal Basis

We respectfully invoke the following UNCAC provisions:

Article 52 & 55: Request for your financial institutions to perform enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs) linked to this case, and to freeze accounts where suspicious activity has been identified.

Article 53 & 57: Bangladesh intends to initiate civil proceedings for the recovery of assets and requests cooperation for restitution.

Article 54(1)(c): Request for application of non-conviction-based confiscation measures, due to the possibility that suspects may evade domestic trial procedures.

1. Disclosure of beneficial ownership of assets registered to the persons listed in Annex I.

Yours sincerely,

Secretary, Ministry of Law
Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh


## Bringing Back Laundered Money - 2

Bringing back billions of dollars laundered out of Bangladesh over the past decade and a half under Sheikh Hasina’s rule—assuming the political will exists and an interim government has taken over—would require a multi-pronged strategy involving domestic legal reform, international cooperation, forensic investigation, and public diplomacy. Here’s a detailed policy-level roadmap:

### 1. Legal and Institutional Preparedness

**a. Form an Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC)**

- Reconstitute the ACC with full autonomy, staffed by individuals with no ties to previous regimes.

- Empower it to investigate past financial crimes, with legal authority to access records from all public institutions and private banks.


**b. Establish a High-Level Task Force**

A specialized task force with members from:

- Ministry of Law, Finance, Foreign Affairs

- Central Bank (Bangladesh Bank)

- Intelligence and investigation agencies

- International financial crime experts


**c. Revise and Enforce Key Laws**

Enforce the Money Laundering Prevention Act and strengthen it to include:

- Retroactive application (with due constitutional care)

- Asset recovery provisions

- Protection for whistleblowers and informants

### 2. Domestic Investigation and Documentation

**a. Audit and Trace**

- Initiate forensic audits of large government projects, banking transactions, and shell company formations since 2009.

- Focus on entities known for corruption (e.g., energy sector, mega-infrastructure projects, defense procurement, etc.).

- Collaborate with private forensic firms to trace fund outflows, especially through trade-based money laundering (over-invoicing, under-invoicing).


**b. Use SARs and CTRs**

Mandate banks and financial institutions to hand over all Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs) from the period under investigation.

### 3. International Cooperation

**a. Request Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA)**

- Sign/activate Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) with financial havens and G20 countries.

- Submit formal Requests for Information (RFIs) under these treaties.


**b. Engage FATF and Egmont Group**

- Request assistance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Egmont Group for intelligence on illicit flows.

- This builds international legitimacy and technical support.


**c. Target Jurisdictions**

Focus on where laundered money is likely to be:

- Singapore, Switzerland, Dubai, UK, Canada, USA, Malaysia, Australia

- Liaise with their financial intelligence units (FIUs) and regulatory bodies.


**d. Asset Freezing Orders**

Seek international court orders to freeze suspected assets, based on evidence gathered at home.

This step requires prima facie proof and cooperation from host countries.

### 4. Legal Action and Repatriation

**a. Civil and Criminal Cases**

File civil suits in relevant jurisdictions for asset recovery.

Where criminal proceedings are possible, push for extradition of key corrupt figures.


**b. Use UNCAC Framework**

Use provisions under the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which Bangladesh has ratified, to pursue asset recovery through international arbitration or negotiation.


**c. Negotiate Repatriation Deals**

Some jurisdictions allow settlement agreements with governments for returning illicit assets without public court battles (e.g., UK's “return of assets” programs).

### 5. Public Diplomacy and Political Legitimacy

**a. Transparency & Updates**

Regular public updates build trust and keep the momentum.

Invite civil society groups and international watchdogs (e.g., Transparency International) to observe and report.


**b. Media Strategy**

Counter possible resistance by international actors sympathetic to the previous regime by launching a global media and advocacy campaign.

Use public shaming of foreign jurisdictions unwilling to cooperate.

### 6. Structural Reforms for the Future

Even if full recovery isn’t possible, the process:

- Deters future laundering

- Rebuilds institutional legitimacy

- Strengthens democratic norms


Reforms should include:

- Mandatory asset declarations for all public officials

- Digital audit trails for all state spending

- Overhaul of banking supervision and offshore capital controls
