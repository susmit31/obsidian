## Sri Lanka recovery
Sri Lanka's economic recovery is a complex and challenging process that involves addressing the root causes of the country's macroeconomic imbalances, restoring debt sustainability, and transforming the economy to create more jobs and reduce poverty. According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka has a great track record in raising living standards and reducing poverty, but the COVID-19 crisis has led to dramatic losses in livelihoods and earnings. The government has implemented a comprehensive economic reforms agenda to boost economic recovery, which includes the following policies:

- **Debt restructuring**: Sri Lanka's public debt is unsustainable, and the country lost international financial market access in 2022. The government is seeking to reduce the unsustainable level of debt and high gross financing needs through debt restructuring and supported by a broader fiscal adjustment. Speedy and successful debt restructuring is critically important to bring Sri Lanka back to a sustainable path, build confidence among investors and development partners, and regain international financial market access.
- **Fiscal consolidation**: The government is aiming to reduce the **fiscal deficit** and increase **revenue collection** through tax reforms, expenditure rationalization, and improved public financial management. The government has also introduced a medium-term fiscal framework to guide fiscal policy and ensure fiscal discipline.
- **Monetary and exchange rate policy**: The government is committed to maintaining **price stability** and a **flexible exchange rate regime**. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has adopted a forward-looking monetary policy framework based on inflation targeting and has increased the policy interest rates to curb inflationary pressures and support the exchange rate. The government has also liberalized the foreign exchange market and removed some import restrictions to facilitate trade and investment.
- **Structural reforms**: The government is pursuing a range of structural reforms to enhance **productivity**, **competitiveness**, and **diversification** of the economy. Some of the key reform areas include improving the investment climate, strengthening the financial sector, promoting digitalization and innovation, enhancing human capital development, and addressing environmental and social challenges. The government has also established a National Productivity Commission to monitor and evaluate the progress and impact of the reforms.

These policies are expected to help Sri Lanka overcome the current crisis and achieve a sustainable trajectory toward poverty reduction and shared prosperity. However, the reforms will also entail some short-term costs and trade-offs, and will require strong political commitment and social consensus. As Sri Lanka emerges from the crisis, it will be important to help the poor and vulnerable get back on their feet and prevent long-term scarring. The World Bank suggests four priorities for Sri Lanka to further transform its economy, create more jobs and achieve prosperity more broadly:

- Increasing **agricultural productivity and earnings**
- Developing a **vibrant and competitive tourism sector**
- Leveraging the potential of the **digital economy**
- Strengthening **social protection and inclusion**


## SCO
The **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)** is a Eurasian political, economic, international security and defence organization established by China and Russia in 2001.  It is the world's largest regional organization in terms of geographic scope and population, covering approximately 80% of the area of Eurasia, 40% of the world population.  As of 2021, its combined GDP was around 20% of global GDP. 

The **purposes** of the SCO are to strengthen mutual trust and good-neighbourliness among the member states, promote effective cooperation in politics, trade, economy, culture, education, energy, transportation, tourism, environmental protection and other fields, safeguard regional peace, security and stability, and create a new international political and economic order that is fair, rational, equal and mutually beneficial. 

Some of the **achievements** of the SCO are:

- Signing the *Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation among the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation* in 2007, which established the *legal basis* for the development of the SCO. 
- Establishing the *Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS)* in 2004, which is a *permanent organ* of the SCO that coordinates the efforts of the member states in combating *terrorism, separatism and extremism*. 
- Launching the *SCO Interbank Consortium* in 2005, which is a *mechanism for financing joint projects* in various fields, such as infrastructure, energy, industry, agriculture, and high technology. 
- Initiating the *SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group* in 2005, which is a *platform for dialogue and cooperation between the SCO and Afghanistan on issues of common interest*, such as security, reconstruction, and development. 
- Expanding the membership of the SCO in *2017*, with the *admission of India and Pakistan* as full members, and in *2023*, with the admission of *Iran* as a full member.  
- Holding regular summits, meetings, and consultations among the heads of state, heads of government, foreign ministers, and other officials of the SCO, as well as various forums, conferences, and exhibitions on various topics, such as culture, education, health, media, youth, women, and sports. 

The **current status** of the SCO is that it is an active and influential regional organization that plays an important role in addressing the regional and global challenges and opportunities. The SCO has established *partnerships and dialogue* with other international and regional organizations, such as the *United Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)*.  The SCO also engages with other countries and entities as observers, dialogue partners, or guest attendees, such as Belarus, Mongolia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union.   The SCO is currently preparing for its *23rd summit*, which will be held in *Beijing, China* in June *2024*. 


## De-dollarisation
- **Two aspects**: *FX Reserve* de-dollarisation, and *transaction* de-dollarisation
- **Rise of the USD**:
	- *Bretton-Woods*
	- *Marshall plan*
	- *Petrodollar*
- ***"...de-dollarization is evident in FX reserves, where the dollar’s share has declined to a record low of 58%.”*** - Meera Chandan, Co-Head of Global FX Strategy, J.P. Morgan
- According to the *IMF* (2020), USD reserves are at a *record-lowest compared to the past 25 years* 
- renminbi makes up just 3% of SWIFT payments (all-time high; 0.03% @2010), versus the dollar’s share of 46% (also all-time high; avg. @43%) and the euro’s share of 32%
- Russian oil is now either sold in the local currencies of the buyers or in the currencies of countries that Russia perceives as friendly. For example, some Indian refiners have begun paying for Russian oil purchased via Dubai-based traders in dirhams, while others are considering doing so in yuan
- major Russian commodity producers have started issuing bonds in yuan
- In September 2022, state-owned oil company Rosneft made a public offering of 10 billion yuan in bonds, followed by a second tranche of 15 billion yuan in March 2023. 
- Total de-dollarisation, at least in the short term, seems unlikely given the current trends. *Partial de-dollarisation*, however, seems to be on the cards, where the *Renminbi* takes on *some of the roles of the USD* in the global south.
- China has for some time been buying increasing amounts of oil and liquefied natural gas from Iran, Venezuela, Russia and parts of Africa in its own currency — **petroyuan**.
- For the Chinese, who are today the world’s top oil importer, they see this move as only logical. But beyond that, moving away from the petrodollar is a strategic priority for countries like China and Russia. Both aim to ultimately reduce their dependency on the dollar, limiting their exposure to US currency risk and the politics of American sanctions regimes. As experts state — such a move would chip away at the US dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, spurring “de-dollarisation.”
- Another indication of de-dollarization is the **rise in central bank gold buying**. Countries like *China, Russia and India* have been *purchasing gold as a means to reduce their dollar holdings*. Central banks have purchased *more gold in recent years* than they have *since records began* being kept *in 1950*. This trend highlights a shift in trust from the US dollar to gold as a safer haven, driven in part by the US and its allies' increasing use of financial sanctions.


## Reserve currency
### Utility of reserves
 Holding reserves in foreign currencies can provide several benefits to a country:

1. **Increasing market confidence** in a country's ability to meet its external obligations.
2. Working as a **shock absorber** for unexpected external shocks.
3. Increasing **international investor confidence**, leading to more foreign direct investment (FDI).
4. Modifying the **foreign exchange rate**.
5. Ensuring **stability** in a country's currency exchange rates by providing a buffer against unexpected fluctuations.
6. Facilitating **international trade** by ensuring a country can pay for imports or convert its currency to other currencies for exports.

Foreign currency reserves can also help a country **maintain liquidity** in case of an economic crisis. A central bank can step in and exchange its foreign currency for the local currency, ensuring companies can continue to import and export competitively.

Foreign currency reserves can also be used to **fund internal projects** such as infrastructure or industry programs.

It is important to note that holding foreign currency reserves can also have some drawbacks. For example, holding large amounts of foreign currency reserves can lead to **opportunity costs** as the country may miss out on higher returns from other investments.

### Criteria for being a reserve
- **Liquidity**
- **Convertibility**
- **Stability**
