## Sri Lanka recovery
Sri Lanka's economic recovery is a complex and challenging process that involves addressing the root causes of the country's macroeconomic imbalances, restoring debt sustainability, and transforming the economy to create more jobs and reduce poverty. According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka has a great track record in raising living standards and reducing poverty, but the COVID-19 crisis has led to dramatic losses in livelihoods and earnings. The government has implemented a comprehensive economic reforms agenda to boost economic recovery, which includes the following policies:

- **Debt restructuring**: Sri Lanka's public debt is unsustainable, and the country lost international financial market access in 2022. The government is seeking to reduce the unsustainable level of debt and high gross financing needs through debt restructuring and supported by a broader fiscal adjustment. Speedy and successful debt restructuring is critically important to bring Sri Lanka back to a sustainable path, build confidence among investors and development partners, and regain international financial market access.
- **Fiscal consolidation**: The government is aiming to reduce the **fiscal deficit** and increase **revenue collection** through tax reforms, expenditure rationalization, and improved public financial management. The government has also introduced a medium-term fiscal framework to guide fiscal policy and ensure fiscal discipline.
- **Monetary and exchange rate policy**: The government is committed to maintaining **price stability** and a **flexible exchange rate regime**. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has adopted a forward-looking monetary policy framework based on inflation targeting and has increased the policy interest rates to curb inflationary pressures and support the exchange rate. The government has also liberalized the foreign exchange market and removed some import restrictions to facilitate trade and investment.
- **Structural reforms**: The government is pursuing a range of structural reforms to enhance **productivity**, **competitiveness**, and **diversification** of the economy. Some of the key reform areas include improving the investment climate, strengthening the financial sector, promoting digitalization and innovation, enhancing human capital development, and addressing environmental and social challenges. The government has also established a National Productivity Commission to monitor and evaluate the progress and impact of the reforms.

These policies are expected to help Sri Lanka overcome the current crisis and achieve a sustainable trajectory toward poverty reduction and shared prosperity. However, the reforms will also entail some short-term costs and trade-offs, and will require strong political commitment and social consensus. As Sri Lanka emerges from the crisis, it will be important to help the poor and vulnerable get back on their feet and prevent long-term scarring. The World Bank suggests four priorities for Sri Lanka to further transform its economy, create more jobs and achieve prosperity more broadly:

- Increasing **agricultural productivity and earnings**
- Developing a **vibrant and competitive tourism sector**
- Leveraging the potential of the **digital economy**
- Strengthening **social protection and inclusion**


## SCO
The **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)** is a Eurasian political, economic, international security and defence organization established by China and Russia in 2001.  It is the world's largest regional organization in terms of geographic scope and population, covering approximately 80% of the area of Eurasia, 40% of the world population.  As of 2021, its combined GDP was around 20% of global GDP. 

The **purposes** of the SCO are to strengthen mutual trust and good-neighbourliness among the member states, promote effective cooperation in politics, trade, economy, culture, education, energy, transportation, tourism, environmental protection and other fields, safeguard regional peace, security and stability, and create a new international political and economic order that is fair, rational, equal and mutually beneficial. 

Some of the **achievements** of the SCO are:

- Signing the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation among the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2007, which established the legal basis for the development of the SCO. 
- Establishing the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in 2004, which is a permanent organ of the SCO that coordinates the efforts of the member states in combating terrorism, separatism and extremism. 
- Launching the SCO Interbank Consortium in 2005, which is a mechanism for financing joint projects in various fields, such as infrastructure, energy, industry, agriculture, and high technology. 
- Initiating the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group in 2005, which is a platform for dialogue and cooperation between the SCO and Afghanistan on issues of common interest, such as security, reconstruction, and development. 
- Expanding the membership of the SCO in 2017, with the admission of India and Pakistan as full members, and in 2023, with the admission of Iran as a full member.  
- Holding regular summits, meetings, and consultations among the heads of state, heads of government, foreign ministers, and other officials of the SCO, as well as various forums, conferences, and exhibitions on various topics, such as culture, education, health, media, youth, women, and sports. 

The **current status** of the SCO is that it is an active and influential regional organization that plays an important role in addressing the regional and global challenges and opportunities. The SCO has established partnerships and dialogue with other international and regional organizations, such as the United Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).  The SCO also engages with other countries and entities as observers, dialogue partners, or guest attendees, such as Belarus, Mongolia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union.   The SCO is currently preparing for its 23rd summit, which will be held in Beijing, China in June 2024.
