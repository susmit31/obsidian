Thank you very much, Dr Nusrat, for goving me the floor. As salamu alaikum everyone. I welcome all my respected teachers and my fellow colleagues to this week's admission review, held on the 4th of April, 2023. Unlike the past few weeks, this week's admission was quite busy - in terms of both the number and the intricacy of the cases. We admitted a total of 35 patients. Among them, x were obstetric cases, and y were gynaecological cases. 

Now let's start our discussion with the gynae cases. There were 4 abortion

Next up, the obstetric cases.

We had 19 patients who presented with full-term pregnancy.
