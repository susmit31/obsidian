Here I attempt to develop my own take on the problems of defining truth and knowledge.
## Knowledge as Resilient True Belief

## Network Theory of Truth
- Truth as an externalist/realist concept
- Truth as a concept linking language and reality
## How Epistemology, Metaphysics, and the Philosophy of Mind and Language Coincide
- "The morning star is the evening star" contains as the subject and the object the same referent but in different senses.
- But what is a "referent"? And what is a "sense"? A referent is taken to be an object, while a sense is taken to be a certain "mode of presentation" i.e., a certain attribute.
- But what is an object?
- So evaluating truth values, and hence knowledge claims, rest upon the metaphysical notion of "object", the linguistic notion of "reference", and the mental notion of "sense"
