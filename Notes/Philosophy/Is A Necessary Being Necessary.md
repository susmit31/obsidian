## Intro
It is a hunch of mine that there can be no a priori arguments that either prove or  disprove the existence of a necessary being. Here I shall attempt to construct a universal defeater for all such arguments.
## Basic Idea
- Show that any a priori argument for a necessary existence (NE), on which all else is contingent, can be applied to _NE itself_, either leading to a contradiction (e.g. saying that both the universe and the concept of an Abrahamic God fit the criteria of NE), or to a vicious regress. 
- Or maybe we could show the absurdity of the concept of _necessity_ itself through philosophical analysis of language.
## Questions to be Answered
- What sort of existence is NE? Surely there are two sorts of existence, one of the material world and the other of logical and mathematical truths.
- Are the concepts of "necessity" and "contingency" in the realm of material existence? Is it a false dichotomy?
- Levels of existence: do abstract concepts necessarily exist beyond the realm of rational thought? e.g. there _are_ prime numbers beyond, say, 100, but _do they exist?_ What is their ontological status?
## Here We Go!
First up: some necessary (no pun intended) definitions.
### Working Definitions
- **Cause and effect**
- **Necessary**: to be distinguished from the sense of "necessary "
- **Contingent**
### Prior Assumptions
- Cause and effect exist (cf. Hume)
### The Argument
- A necessary being cannot have parts, since that would make it contingent on the parts
- But what are "parts"?
-  The concept of _necessity_ is **contingent upon** our use of language (?)
