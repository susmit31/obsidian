## 🩸 Warfarin vs Heparin/LMWH/Fondaparinux — Indications & Rationale

### ⚖️ General Principle
- **Heparins (UFH/LMWH/fondaparinux):** Injectable, rapid-onset, short-acting. Ideal for **acute**, **bridging**, or **hospital-based** scenarios.
- **Warfarin (coumarins):** Oral, delayed-onset, long-acting. Best for **chronic**, **long-term outpatient** anticoagulation.

## ✅ Heparin/LMWH/Fondaparinux Indications — and Why

### 1. **Prevention and treatment of VTE**
- **Why heparins?**  
  Rapid action prevents clot propagation in acute DVT/PE. LMWH/fondaparinux preferred for outpatient therapy due to predictable kinetics.
- **Transition:** Bridging to warfarin for long-term care.

### 2. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**
- **Why heparins?**  
  Immediate anticoagulation during catheter manipulation is critical. UFH or bivalirudin used intra-procedurally. Warfarin is useless here due to delay in action.

### 3. **Post-thrombolysis for MI**
- **Why heparins?**  
  Following thrombolytics (e.g. streptokinase), anticoagulation prevents re-occlusion. LMWH preferred for ease and safety. Warfarin not used in acute MI phase.

### 4. **Unstable angina pectoris**
- **Why heparins?**  
  Part of antithrombotic regimen (alongside antiplatelets) in ACS. LMWH reduces risk of cardiac events before PCI or spontaneous resolution. Warfarin has no role in ACS management.

### 5. **Non-Q wave MI (NSTEMI)**
- **Why heparins?**  
  Same rationale as unstable angina — inhibits thrombus growth, especially subendocardial clots. Rapid onset is essential.

### 6. **Acute peripheral arterial occlusion**
- **Why heparins?**  
  UFH reduces thrombus burden pre- or peri-operatively. Warfarin’s delay makes it unsuitable in acute ischemia.

### 7. **Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)**
- **Why heparins?**  
  CPB requires full anticoagulation to prevent clots in extracorporeal circuits. Only UFH is used due to complete reversibility with protamine. Warfarin? Not even in the room.

### 8. **Haemodialysis and haemofiltration**
- **Why heparins?**  
  Prevents clotting in extracorporeal filters/tubing. UFH or LMWH given during sessions. Oral anticoagulants can't provide precise, on-demand control.

## ✅ Warfarin (Coumarin) Indications — and Why It’s Preferred Over Heparins

### 1. **Prevention and treatment of VTE**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  Heparin for acute phase; warfarin for long-term oral maintenance. Heparin is impractical for chronic use.

### 2. **Arterial embolism (non-cardiac source)**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  For chronic embolic risk, warfarin’s oral route and INR-based titration are ideal. Heparin used only if rapid anticoagulation is acutely needed.

### 3. **Atrial fibrillation (with stroke risk factors)**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  AF is a chronic condition. Warfarin is proven to prevent thromboembolism long-term. Heparin may bridge during initiation.

### 4. **Mobile mural thrombus post-MI**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  Risk of embolism from LV thrombi persists post-MI. Warfarin handles this over weeks/months. Heparin too short-acting.

### 5. **Extensive anterior MI**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  Increased thrombus risk in akinetic LV wall → long-term anticoagulation. Warfarin fits the bill; heparin is just a stopgap.

### 6. **Dilated cardiomyopathy**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  Blood stasis predisposes to intracardiac thrombus. Warfarin allows chronic oral control; heparin’s injection and cost make it impractical.

### 7. **Cardioversion**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  Risk of embolism during rhythm conversion. Guidelines mandate 3 weeks pre- and 4 weeks post-cardioversion anticoagulation — warfarin covers that window.

### 8. **Ischemic stroke in antiphospholipid syndrome**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  APS needs lifelong anticoagulation. Warfarin remains standard of care. Heparin is reserved for pregnancy or warfarin failure.

### 9. **Mitral stenosis or MR with AF**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  High embolic risk in rheumatic heart disease. Warfarin is the only oral agent with proven efficacy. Heparin unsuitable for long-term use.

### 10. **Recurrent VTE while on warfarin**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  Heparin may be used temporarily, but warfarin dose is usually adjusted. If resistant, alternatives like DOACs or lifelong LMWH may be considered.

### 11. **Mechanical prosthetic cardiac valves**
- **Why warfarin > heparin?**  
  High thrombogenicity demands long-term anticoagulation. Warfarin is the only oral drug shown to work here. Heparin reserved for bridging (e.g., perioperative).

### 📌 Golden Rule:
> **Use heparins when you need FAST and CONTROLLED anticoagulation. Use warfarin when you need CHRONIC, STABLE, ORAL anticoagulation.**
