# Introduction
## Skills to Achieve

- Locate lesions (\*\*\*)
- Predict functional deficits (in addition to the ones mentioned in the vignette) (\*\*)
- Identify arteries involved (\*) (less important since most of the time these textbook syndromes occur due to tumours or other lesions, and rarely due to such well-targetedstrokes)

## Why?
To motivate the forthcoming study plan and the previously stated target skills, we'll take a look at a table differentiating between common brainstem stroke syndromes.

# Reflexes
## Light and Accommodation Reflexes


### Simplified Pathways
- Light enters through the retina and passes through the optic nerves to the primary visual cortex, V1, generating the visual experience
- V1 signals are transmitted to V2, V3 etc for higher-order processing
- Another part of the signals from CN2 go to the pretectal nucleus, which then forwards it to Edinger-Westphal nuclei *of both sides*, thereby triggering, through CN3 efferents, the **light reflex** in both eyes
- In case of accommodation, signals from V2, V3 etc higher order visual centres of both sides directly travel to EWN of both sides, thereby triggering the **accommodation reflex**.

### Clinico-anatomical correlations
- Since the *accommodation reflex bypasses pretectal nucleus*, lesions of the pretectal nucleus will cause **light-near dissociation**
- Also, if the retina/CN2/optic chiasm happens on one side, then the pretectal nucleus of that side won't be stimulated when light is shone, and so light reflex doesn't get triggered. However since the accommodation reflex depends on afferents from higher-order visual processing which is inherently bilateral where both V1's share information through the corpus callosum, during lesions of retina/CN2 etc of one side, the other side will still contribute to the V2 and higher, and that means that V2 on the diseased side will trigger accommodation - i.e. there's also light-near dissociation in this case.


### Aetiology of LND

- **Argyll-Robertson pupil**: Pretectal nucleus lesion due to syphilis, which causes LND by the aforementioned mechanism.
- **Holmes-Adie’s Tonic Pupil**: Results from damage to the ciliary ganglion or postganglionic parasympathetic fibers (e.g., due to viral infection, diabetes, or autoimmune conditions like Sjögren’s syndrome). The pupil is initially dilated, with slow or absent light response. Over time, aberrant regeneration of fibers to the ciliary muscle (for accommodation) restores the near response, but the light response remains poor.

### RAPD (Marcus-Gunn Pupil) Mechanism

- RAPD results from **asymmetric afferent pathway damage** (retina or optic nerve) reducing light signal transmission from the affected eye to the pretectal nucleus.
- During the swinging flashlight test, weaker afferent input from the affected eye leads to reduced EWN activation, causing less pupillary constriction or paradoxical dilation in both eyes when the affected eye is stimulated.
- The bilateral projection from the pretectal nucleus to both EWNs ensures that the defect affects both pupils’ responses, making RAPD a sensitive indicator of unilateral or asymmetric afferent pathology.
- The near reflex is spared because it relies on cortical pathways, not the pretectal nucleus, explaining *light-near dissociation in RAPD* cases.
