### Hard Questions (36–50)

These questions require deeper analysis, application, or inference based on the table.

36. A patient with a slow acetylator status is prescribed an antituberculous drug. Which drug are they most at risk of developing hepatitis from, and why?  
    (Answer: Isoniazid; the table notes hepatitis is more common in patients with a slow acetylator status)
37. A patient reports vision changes after starting antituberculous treatment. Which drug are they likely taking, and what specific adverse reaction might they be experiencing?  
    (Answer: Ethambutol; retrobulbar neuritis, which can cause reduced visual acuity and color vision)
38. A patient on antituberculous treatment develops seizures. Which drug might be responsible, and is this a major or less common adverse reaction?  
    (Answer: Isoniazid; less common adverse reaction)
39. A patient with a history of gout is prescribed Pyrazinamide. What adverse reactions should the doctor monitor for, and why?  
    (Answer: Hyperuricaemia and gout; Pyrazinamide lists both as adverse reactions, which could worsen the patient’s condition)
40. A patient on Rifampicin develops a fever. Is this a major or less common adverse reaction, and what other liver-related reaction should the doctor check for?  
    (Answer: Major (febrile reactions); they should also check for hepatitis, a major adverse reaction of Rifampicin)
41. A patient reports hearing loss after starting antituberculous treatment. Which drug is likely responsible, and what other kidney-related reaction might they be at risk for?  
    (Answer: Streptomycin (8th nerve damage); they are also at risk for nephrotoxicity)
42. A doctor prescribes pyridoxine alongside an antituberculous drug to reduce the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Which drug are they likely prescribing pyridoxine with, and what other adverse reaction of this drug affects the liver?  
    (Answer: Isoniazid; hepatitis)
43. A patient on Ethambutol develops joint pain. Is this a major or less common adverse reaction, and what other vision-related reaction should the doctor monitor for?

44. A patient with a history of kidney disease is prescribed Streptomycin. What adverse reactions should the doctor be cautious of, and why?  
    (Answer: Nephrotoxicity and agranulocytosis; both affect the kidneys and blood, which could complicate the patient’s condition)
45. A patient on Pyrazinamide develops a rash. Is this a major or less common adverse reaction, and what other reaction might indicate liver damage?
